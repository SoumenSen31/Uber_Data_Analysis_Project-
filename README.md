# 🚖 Uber Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber trip data to uncover key insights about customer behavior, ride patterns, and booking trends.  
The analysis answers six business-critical questions focusing on ride categories, purposes, booking times, seasonal trends, weekly activity, and trip distances.

All analysis is implemented inside the Jupyter Notebook:

**`uber_data_analysis.ipynb`**

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
The notebook answers the following questions:

1. **In which category do people book the most Uber rides?**  
2. **For which purpose do people book Uber rides the most?**  
3. **At what time do people book cabs the most from Uber?**  
4. **In which months do people book Uber rides less frequently?**  
5. **On which days of the week do people book Uber rides the most?**  
6. **How many miles do people usually book a cab for through Uber?**

These form the core structure of the entire analysis.
